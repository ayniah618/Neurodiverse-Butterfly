<p>My name is Chloe Johnston,  I was diagnosed in October of 2017 at the age of 13 with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.  Not long after I found out I have Asperger's Syndrome and this is the beginning of me finding out what I want to do with my life. I hope to use this blog, Nuerodiverse Butterflies, to help me find my voice and as a way to help other girls who are walking this same road to find freedom. And this is one of the many superpowers that are going to make me, me. I want to make my mark on the world and be known for something great. I want to make this world a better place, because to be honest, it kinda sucks right now. I want to spread peace and joy in this world full of hatred, and I want to spread a positive message as I walk this journey out. “Do something today that your future self will thank you for.”-Entity Magazine “If we do not share our stories and shine a light on inequities, things will not change.”-Ellen Pao “To be able to code gives you the freedom  to build anything and that is just so empowering.”-Karlie Kloss 
As Erin Van Vuren said, “I will not be another flower, picked for my beauty and left to die. I will be wild, difficult to find, and impossible to forget.”
